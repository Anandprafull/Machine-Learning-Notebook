# Week 3: Advice for applying machine learning

This week you'll learn best practices for training and evaluating your learning algorithms to improve performance. This will cover a wide range of useful advice about the machine learning lifecycle, tuning your model, and also improving your training data.

## Learning Objectives

* Evaluate and then modify your learning algorithm or data to improve your model's performance
* Evaluate your learning algorithm using cross validation and test datasets.
* Diagnose bias and variance in your learning algorithm
* Use regularization to adjust bias and variance in your learning algorithm
* Identify a baseline level of performance for your learning algorithm
* Understand how bias and variance apply to neural networks
* Learn about the iterative loop of Machine Learning Development that's used to update and improve a machine learning model
* Learn to use error analysis to identify the types of errors that a learning algorithm is making
* Learn how to add more training data to improve your model, including data augmentation and data synthesis
* Use transfer learning to improve your model's performance.
* Learn to include fairness and ethics in your machine learning model
