# Week 2: Neural network training

This week, you'll learn how to train your model in TensorFlow, and also learn about other important activation functions (besides the sigmoid function), and where to use each type in a neural network. You'll also learn how to go beyond binary...

## Learning Objectives

* Train a neural network on data using TensorFlow
* Understand the difference between various activation functions (sigmoid, ReLU, and linear)
* Understand which activation functions to use for which type of layer
* Understand why we need non-linear activation functions
* Understand multiclass classification
* Calculate the softmax activation for implementing multiclass classification
* Use the categorical cross entropy loss function for multiclass classification
* Use the recommended method for implementing multiclass classification in code
* (Optional): Explain the difference between multi-label and multiclass classification
