# Week 1: Neural Networks

This week, you'll learn about neural networks and how to use them for classification tasks. You'll use the TensorFlow framework to build a neural network with just a few lines of code. Then, dive deeper by learning how to code up your own neural...

## Learning Objectives

* Get familiar with the diagram and components of a neural network
* Understand the concept of a "layer" in a neural network
* Understand how neural networks learn new features.
* Understand how activations are calculated at each layer.
* Learn how a neural network can perform classification on an image.
* Use a framework, TensorFlow, to build a neural network for classification of an image.
* Learn how data goes into and out of a neural network layer in TensorFlow
* Build a neural network in regular Python code (from scratch) to make predictions.
* (Optional): Learn how neural networks use parallel processing (vectorization) to make computations faster.
