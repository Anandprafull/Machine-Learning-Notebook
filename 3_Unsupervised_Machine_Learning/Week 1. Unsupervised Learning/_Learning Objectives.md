# Week 1: Unsupervised Learning

This week, you will learn two key unsupervised learning algorithms: clustering and anomaly detection

## Learning Objectives

* Implement the k-means optimization objective
* Initialize the k-means algorithm
* Choose the number of clusters for the k-means algorithm
* Implement an anomaly detection system
* Decide when to use supervised learning vs. anomaly detection
* Implement the centroid update function in k-means
* Implement the function that finds the closest centroids to each point in k-means
